In this exercise I worked on a web page like the Google search bar, I did it in italian since it's my main language.
The site has:<br>
1- a search bar with the Google logo on top of it;<br>
2- a nav-bar were are located the links of Google like, Google store, image or gmail (they doesn't work since I plan to make it working in every function when I learn js)<br>
3- the two buttons where one should lead you to your research, the other one to a casual search (they doesn't work either)<br>
4- and last, a footer wich contains information about Google (the links doesn't work here either)
